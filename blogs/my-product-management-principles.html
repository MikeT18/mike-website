          <h2>Start with why</h2>
            <p>Understand why we’re trying to do what we’re trying to do.</p>
          <h2>Design for real people</h2>
            <p>Be conscious that the thing the products you’re designing and delivering is going to be used by real people, this means we need to ensure that it’s been tested with real people and that we stay engaged with real people after the product is delivered. Context is also key here, testing something in a usability lab is ok but there is no substitute for people using the product in their context.</p>
          <h2>Be courageous, make decisions, move forwards</h2>
            <p>It’s important as a Product person that we move forward with our products to get them live, this will require at times to make decisions based on evidence but it won’t be absolute guarantee. It’s better to build consensus but sometimes a Product person needs to make a decision to move forward.</p>
          <h2>Test whats important</h2>
            <p>We have finite time and infinite questions, prioritise whats important to spend the design, research and technical effort on.</p>
          <h2>Pragmatism over purist thinking</h2>
            <p>Being user centred means delivering services that make a difference, don’t get caught in worrying about the product being perfect, be pragmatic, deliver the product, add value and iterate.</p>
          <h2>Prepare to go live</h2>
            <p>From the start understand your goal is to get the best product live, think about how it will be managed at scale.</p>
