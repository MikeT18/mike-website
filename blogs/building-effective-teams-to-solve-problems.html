            <h2>Building Effective Teams to Solve Problems</h2>
            <h3>The Importance of Understanding Problems</h3> 
            <p>Successful problem solving requires a clear understanding of the problem at hand. Teams should begin by identifying the stakeholder who "owns" the problem and ensuring that the team is built with the right skills and experiences to address it. This means that teams should start small and grow as the problem becomes better understood.</p>
            <h3>Talking to People to Understand Problems</h3> 
            <p>Most problems require engaging with people, so it's important for teams to have individuals or a group of individuals who can understand the problem, identify the right people to ask questions, and translate the answers into actionable steps. Teams should also have a clear communication strategy to ensure that everyone is working towards the same goal.</p>  
            <h3>Scaling Teams</h3>
            <p>Teams with 10 or more people need to have a clear understanding of the problem(s) and a set of actionable steps to address it. Otherwise, they may struggle with communication, direction, and a sense of purpose, which can hinder their ability to solve problems effectively.</p>
            <h3>Skills and Experience over Job Titles</h3>
            <p>When building teams, it's important to focus on what needs to be delivered and the skills and experiences required to solve the problem, rather than job titles. Job titles provide a false sense of certainty about an individual's ability, competence, and experience. Teams should be composed of individuals with the right skills and experiences to address the problem, regardless of their job title.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, effective problem solving requires a clear understanding of the problem, engagement with people, a well-defined communication strategy, and a team built with the right skills and experiences. By focusing on these elements, teams can work towards solving problems in an efficient and effective manner.</p>
